\title{Final Project- Tunable Ring Oscillator}
\author{Dan Kearney and Theo Thompson}
\date{May 9, 2013}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section*{Prelab}
Talk about mathematical analysis, ``turn on power'' analysis, time constants, in general what the starver does, etc.\\
Talk about simulation results #yolo\\
mention the many everyday application sof a ring oscillator

\section{Results}
talk about plots. maybe fit a theoretical to them.
plots:\\
signal for several bias voltages (same plot?)\\
signal for different branches\\
comparison to simulation results\\
frequency as a function of bias voltage\
\section{Postlab}
talk about stuff we didn't expect. why was one branch different? why do we exist? why driving a speaker doesn't make sense. Applications of our work.
